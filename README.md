# BBUS_AEGIS_PACK
A commission pack for AEGIS Security, an cool ArmA 3 unit!1!

Hi.
I've hurried this repo, my apologies.
Use the issues to let me know about things.
I will check pull requests.

Follow ArmA 3 standards as the BI community wiki dictates, and it should be good. Don't be afraid to make a pull request; I'll handle adding into the mod so I can make it fit in, no biggie.

Don't reupload the mod or any modifications, and do not put this inside packs. Eternal Inquisator on Steam has the say.

Here's the Steam Workshop link:

Good luck.
